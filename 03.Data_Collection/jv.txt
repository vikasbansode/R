Sara Ali Khan is one of those lucky star-kids who struck gold in Bollywood with her first two films itself. Her debut Kedarnath did good business at the box office, and Simmba crossed over Rs 230 crore. Even before she entered the film industry, she had got much appreciation and love for her vivacious personality on Karan Johar's chat show.
As a result, her fan-base grew by leaps and bounds, and that can be seen with the innumerable likes and comments on her Instagram post. Recently, a throwback picture of the actress made its way to the internet, and netizens were awestruck by the uncanny resemblance to her step-brother Taimur.
Sara adores her little brother, and her posts on Instagram are proof of that. She calls him her "bundle of happiness".
"To be honest, I don't get to see Taimur very often, but every time I do, he's a bundle of happiness. When Taimur is happy, the whole room is happy. He is my blood and the source of my father's joy," the Simmba actress had told a magazine.
Ever since Sara made her Bollywood debut, she has often been compared to her mom Amrita Singh. But she claims that she is more like her father, Saif Ali Khan.
"He's a lot like me - we're both readers, we both like history, we're both travellers. He is 25 years older than me, which isn't a lot. I am right in between the age gap of Taimur [Ali Khan] and my father," added Sara.
